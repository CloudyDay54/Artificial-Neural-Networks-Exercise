For this analysis we will cover one of life's most important topics - Wine! All joking aside, wine fraud is actually very real thing. Let's see if Neural Networks can help with this problem! We will use the wine data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It has various chemical features of different wines, all grown in the same region in Italy, but the data is labeled by three different possible cultivars. We will try to build a model that can classify what cultivar a wine belongs to based on its chemical features using Neural Networks. You can get the data here..
